            DATTEBAYO! Yup! This is the legendary Dattebayo that managed to make Naruto, one of the most memorable characters in the entire anime industry. There is no concrete reason as to what this word means but it doesn't matter. It is a signature phrase that makes this man so special and recognizable and nothing is better than that.Here are the greatest Naruto quotes that embody his mottos: ‘never give up’ and ‘never go back on your words’, and I’m sure they will resonate with you. 1. “I’m not gonna run away, I never go back on my word! That’s my nindo: my ninja way.” — Naruto 2. “A place where someone still thinks about you is a place you can call home.” — Jiraiya 3.
